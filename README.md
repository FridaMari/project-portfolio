# Technigo - React Portfolio Project

The aim with this project was to build a portfolio showcasing earlier projects, using reusable components and following a provided design as closely as possible.

### The Problem

I started off creating components for the different sections as well as some smaller components that I wanted to be reusable, such as photo and button components. Thereafter a json with all the previous projects that I wanted to display. A lot of CSS styling followed, trying to recreate the design that was prodvided.
